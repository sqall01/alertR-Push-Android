# alertR Push Android App

The source code of the [official Android App](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.alertr.alertralarmnotification) of the [alertR alarm and monitoring system](https://github.com/sqall01/alertR) to receive push notifications. In order to use this app, you need to register an account at [alertr.de](https://alertr.de) and follow the setup instructions. If you are searching for a detailed description of the push service design, please read the pages in the official alertR [Github Wiki](https://github.com/sqall01/alertR/wiki/Infrastructure#infrastructure_push).

The icon used by the app is a modified version of an icon of the user [qubodup](https://openclipart.org/user-detail/qubodup).
